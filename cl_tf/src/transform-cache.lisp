;;;
;;; We implement a two-level cache. The first level is on a per-second
;;; basis and the second level is a temporally ordered array that
;;; keeps all transformations between the same frames (frame id and
;;; child id equal) for one second.
;;;
;;; The first cache level makes garbage collection very fast. We
;;; collect all transforms of the complete 1s interval at once.
;;;
;;; The second level cache is a fixed-sized array which is resized
;;; when needed. We assume that transforms come in at relatively fixed
;;; rates. That means only a few resize operations should be needed at
;;; the beginning.
